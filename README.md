# Retail Customer Analytics Dashboard
End-to-end Customer Shopping Behavior Analytics project using Python, SQL, and Power BI. Analyzes purchase patterns, customer segments, discounts, seasons, and payment preferences to uncover trends, improve engagement, and support data-driven marketing and product decisions.

## Overview

This project explores how customers shop, decide, and engage across products, seasons, and channels. By combining data engineering, analytics, and visualization, it turns raw transaction data into clear business insights that help improve sales performance, customer experience, and long-term loyalty.

Built with a real-world retail mindset, the dashboard is designed for decision makers who want clarity, not complexity.

## Business Context

Retail behavior is changing fast. Customers respond differently to discounts, reviews, payment options, and seasons. Without a structured analytics layer, these signals remain hidden.

This project answers a core business question:

**How can the company use consumer shopping data to identify trends, improve engagement, and optimize marketing and product strategies?**

## What This Project Delivers

### Data Preparation & Modeling

Customer shopping data is cleaned, transformed, and structured using Python to ensure accuracy, consistency, and analytical readiness.

### Interactive Dashboard

Power BI brings the analysis to life through an interactive dashboard that highlights:

* Customer purchase patterns
* Product and category performance
* Impact of discounts and seasons
* Payment preferences and channel behavior
* High-value and repeat customer segments

The visuals are designed to be intuitive, executive-friendly, and action-oriented.
